# SurfsUp Challenge

## Overview

### Purpose
To collect the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if a client's surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Apps
Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, SQLite

#### Code:
SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb (File)

### Results
Three key differences:
- June avg temperature: 75 degrees vs December avg temperature: 71 degrees
- June max temperature: 85 degrees vs December max temperature: 83 degrees
- June min temperature: 64 degrees vs December min temperature: 56 degrees

### Summary

It would be a good bet to sustain this operation year-round. Most of the temps fall between 69 and 85 degrees, perfect for ice cream year-round.  More analysis would include average number of days above 70 and how often that temperature is recorded in consecutive days. Conversely, include average number of days where temps are below 60 and how often that temp is recorded in consecutive days.
